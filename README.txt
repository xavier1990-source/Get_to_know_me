Hello Git and GitHub

My name is Brandon Xavier Lassiter

I am new to the coding world but look forward to learning from each and every one of you!

I came to coding because I am looking for something I can do on the side to make extra money as well as a backup plan incase my first career does not pan out. 

I accept constructive criticism very well so please reach out to me should you see anything that needs correction on my end.

Thank you all!
